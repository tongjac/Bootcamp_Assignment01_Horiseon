# Bootcamp Assignment 01 (Horiseon Code Refactor)
This assignment's purpose is to refactor template code for accessibility and as per other requests of the client.

The client has set standards to the following:
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

Both the index HTML page and CSS have been reworked to these standards such that the order of presentation of the front end matches up closely with those declared and called for in the back end. Images have included alt text for accessbility and bot indexing, as well as title text for further accessibility for screen readers and other image-to-text/speech applications. Both the index HTML and CSS have programmer (yours truly) comments for readability and ease of identification for future code modifications. The title element has been listed as the company's name, Horiseon.

Visual integrity to the original mock-up has been maintained throughout this process, with a reduction in total lines of code compared to the original index.html and style.css assignment templates.
